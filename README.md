# Calculator in Vue.js
This calculator written in vue.js is for my subject at NTNU: IDATT2105 Full-stack application development.

To run this calculator, run the following commands in Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal or any other shell:

    git clone https://github.com/BeatsuDev/VueCalculator.git
    cd VueCalculator
    npm install
    npm run dev
    
Note that node.js version 16 (I believe it's 16...) or higher is required. I've tested it with node.js version 18.13.0. Get your newest version of node here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
